### Versioning
Versioning is done automatically done with [Semantics](https://github.com/stevenmatthewt/semantics).
To increase the version any commit in master branch should start with `major:`, `minor:` or `patch:`.
If you squash merge make sure your **git message aka Merge Request Title** starts with one of these.

Once the branch was merged to master, semantics will create an incremented git tag.
Additional the cross-compiled binaries for windows, darwin and linux will be uploaded to releases.
